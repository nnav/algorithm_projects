/**
 * Chapter 8: Dynamic Programming
 * 
 * 8-3. [4] The longest common substring (not subsequence) of two strings X and
 * Y is the longest string that appears as a run of consecutive letters in both
 * strings. For example, the longest common substring of photograph and
 * tomography is ograph.
 * 
 * (a) Let n = |X| and m = |Y |. Give a Θ(nm) dynamic programming algorithm for
 * longest common substring based on the longest common subsequence/edit
 * distance algorithm. (b) Give a simpler Θ(nm) algorithm that does not rely on
 * dynamic programming.
