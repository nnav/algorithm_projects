 * The Grinch is given the job of partitioning 2n players into two teams of n
players each. Each player has a numerical rating that measures how good he/she is
at the game. He seeks to divide the players as unfairly as possible, so as to create
the biggest possible talent imbalance between team A and team B. Show how the
Grinch can do the job in O(n log n) time.
